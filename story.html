    <h2 align="center">MY STORY</h2>
    <br>
    <hr>
    <p>Growing up, I was always shy and hesitant to step outside my comfort zone, convinced that it was better to be safe than sorry. My mindset changed during a college semester abroad when <b>I found myself alone</b> in a bustling marketplace with a map I couldn't read and a phrasebook that offered little help. I was overwhelmed and on the verge of giving up, but the friendly smile of a street vendor selling fresh fruit gave me the courage to try. With a mix of broken phrases and hand gestures, I not only bought the sweetest mango I've ever tasted but also learned that vulnerability is often the first step toward genuine human. <u>That day taught me that the best stories are found just beyond the safe, well-marked path, and I've been seeking them ever since </u></p>

    <p>To overcome my introverted personality, I had to stop seeing it as a weakness and start understanding it as a preference . <i> For years</i>, I believed I was at a disadvantage in a world that rewarded being outgoing and outspoken. I was the child who preferred the quiet corner with a book over the bustling playground, the student who dreaded speaking in class, and the employee who faded into the background during meetings. This created a cycle of anxiety and low confidence that held me back from connecting with others and achieving my goals.</p>

    <p>My turning point came from a conscious decision to challenge my comfort zone, not to become an extrovert, but to develop the communication skills I lacked. I started small, pushing myself to initiate brief, low-stakes conversations. I joined a new club focused on one of my passions, which gave me a comfortable environment to practice speaking. My fear of being judged gradually faded as I realized that focusing on others' passions and asking open-ended questions made interactions less about me and more about a shared connection. Over time, these small acts of courage built a foundation of confidence. While I still cherish my solitude to recharge, I now have the ability to engage with the world on my own terms, not out of obligation, but with a genuine sense of connection.</p>
